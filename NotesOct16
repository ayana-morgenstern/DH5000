Jekyll. 
Dynamic websites vs static --> Dynamic needs databases. Static does not, and can have everything hand-coded by hand or uses Jekyll.
Github is built with a static site generator. 
Can keep writing in single file, and then with generator, can turn that text into a website, into a PDF, a word doc. 
Keeps things safe and future proof.
