# Text Analysis
## Reading: *How Not To Read A Million Books*
About what not to read. 

About casting a wider net, using text-mining to:
 1. identify word boundaries, sentence boundaries, standard spellings, parts of speech and lemmata.
 2. find patterns in a single work, in a subset of the MONK collection, or across everything we have.
 *** Example:
 **1. With Gertrude Stein's novel it:  applied “a frequent pattern analysis algorithm” that looked at every sequence of 
 three words in the book, and any patterns across those trigrams, but “executing the algorithm on 
 *Making* generated thousands of patterns since each slight variation in a repetition generated a new pattern."
 **2. Appearance of the devil: we can see WHEN figures appear in texts and what these patterns mean.
 
 ###Best Practices when Data Mining:
1. Make assumptions explicit
2. Use multiple representations and methodologies
3. Report all trials (including failures)
4. Make data available and methods reproducible
5. Engage in peer review of methodology

###General Thoughts:
- About what is absent. How texts differ from each other as much as how they are similar. 
- Skepticism: Specifically, they point out that there are some key practices and assumptions in data-mining and machine 
learning that literary users of these tools may not fully appreciate or understand, and that without an understanding 
of fundamental principles, it is easy to misinterpret or overstate the significance of statistical results:
The temptation in applying machine learning methods to humanities data is to interpret a computed result as some 
form of proof or determinate answer. In this case, the validity of the evidence lies inherent in the technology. This can 
be problematic when the methods are treated as a black box, a critic ex machina.
- Have to be careful about manipulating data: can use it to prove different things.
