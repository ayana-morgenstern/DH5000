# Accessibility

## Reading: Accessibility Whack-a-mole:

### Conflicts of Accessibility:

- Sometimes when you try and solve one accessibility problem, you create others: IE: for dyslexics, low contrast between text and background are helpful, but this will be a problem for those who are visually impaired. 
- With every change we make, we need to continually check that it doesn’t impair someone else’s experience.

### Fonts: 
- "And it’s not just dyslexia that is sensitive to typography; we recently had a usability testing participant who explained that some people on the autism spectrum struggle with certain fonts, too. And therein lies the problem: there’s a great deal of diversity within neurodiversity. What works for me doesn’t work for everyone with dyslexia; not everyone on the autism spectrum gives a flip about fonts, but some really do."
-  The most practical (and universal) approach would be to build a standards-compliant site that would allow users to override styles with their own preferred fonts and/or colors. And indeed, users should always be able to override styles. But although customization is great if you know what works for you, in my experience (as someone who was diagnosed with dyslexia quite late), I didn’t always know why something was hard, let alone what might help. I wanted to see if there was more we could do for our users.
- Modifying fonts to make the characters look more distinct: change openings, angles of glyphs so they don't touch/run together. 

### Selecting a Typeface:
- Look closely and critically.
- To serif or not? sans serifs tend to be easier to read!
- Use **bold** for emphasis instead of *italics* : this is also easier to distinguish/doesn't slow reading speed.
