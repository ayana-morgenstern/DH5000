# Accessibility

## Reading: *Accessibility Whack-a-mole*:

### Conflicts of Accessibility:

- Sometimes when you try and solve one accessibility problem, you create others: IE: for dyslexics, low contrast between text and background are helpful, but this will be a problem for those who are visually impaired. 
- With every change we make, we need to continually check that it doesn’t impair someone else’s experience.

### Fonts: 
- "And it’s not just dyslexia that is sensitive to typography; we recently had a usability testing participant who explained that some people on the autism spectrum struggle with certain fonts, too. And therein lies the problem: there’s a great deal of diversity within neurodiversity. What works for me doesn’t work for everyone with dyslexia; not everyone on the autism spectrum gives a flip about fonts, but some really do."
-  The most practical (and universal) approach would be to build a standards-compliant site that would allow users to override styles with their own preferred fonts and/or colors. And indeed, users should always be able to override styles. But although customization is great if you know what works for you, in my experience (as someone who was diagnosed with dyslexia quite late), I didn’t always know why something was hard, let alone what might help. I wanted to see if there was more we could do for our users.
- Modifying fonts to make the characters look more distinct: change openings, angles of glyphs so they don't touch/run together. 

### Selecting a Typeface:
- Look closely and critically.
- To serif or not? sans serifs tend to be easier to read!
- Use **bold** for emphasis instead of *italics* : this is also easier to distinguish/doesn't slow reading speed. 
- Underline with care: good for links, but can interfere with some functions/descenders. 

- Think about **Space**:
- Comfortable line lengths, generous line heights, sensible line spacing. 

### Words:
- Don't use jargon, try and use clear and conscise language. 

### Nothing is ever perfect/fixed:
- Build with web standards. Ensure that whatever adaptive technologies or techniques people use will work with your site.
- Think twice about icon fonts. All of your icons will disappear if someone overrides your site’s fonts.
- Show people how to override font styles. Would your users benefit from a how-to like the BBC’s?

## Reading: *I Am Not Broken: The Language of Disability*:
- Ableism is that belief that everyone who is able-bodied is “normal” and everyone else is abnormal. Abelism is probably one of the most common kinds of –ism’s, and it rarely gets talked about.
- We are not broken; we’re just a different kind of normal. We are not incapable or unable; we just get things done a little differently.
- Reading helps us become more empathic, more tuned in to those around us. I want my daughter to love literature, regardless of what genre(s) she ends up enjoying, but I want her to learn from it. Ableism is history. We deserve the books we read to reflect this. We owe it to ourselves, to our society, and to our progeny. We owe it to this progressive, fantastic genre. The way we think and talk about disabilities needs to change. Period.
- We are not broken. We are not bent.
- We are powerful, capable, beautiful people. We are important. We are normal. Our normal might be a little different than yours, but it is still normal. We’re no better or worse, more capable or incapable than anyone else. Just different, and shouldn’t we celebrate that?
