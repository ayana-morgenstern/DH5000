# Computational Creativity

## Reading: *Making things: Photobashing as Archaeological Remediation? by Tara Copplestone*: 
- Photobashing: – a technique by which one takes photos and applies various techniques such as painting, filtering, overlaying and otherwise obliterating the original photo through manipulation.
- Photobashing, due to sitting at an intersection of subjective processes and mechanical capture, allows for some interesting interactions and reflexivity between both sides of this discussion – whilst bashing away you think about how and why the photos were taken in particular ways, how your processes alter or engage with this and how the various remediation’s both affect and effect that relationship.
- Photobashing is a technique which (to my knowledge) has not found a huge amount of use in the archaeological processes. Despite this it provides a space where an interesting interplay between the subjective, mechanical and data driven capture elements of archaeological work-flow can be explored in a way which layers and potentially inverts the usual relationship.

## Reading: *Generonimos by Kate Compton*:
- The Generominos are a physical instantiation of a new framework by Kate Compton for thinking about generative interactive art and games. Generative methods often involve taking one kind of data and transforming it into another.
- The Generominos cards are a constructive model of how pipelines transform the datastreams generated from inputs into the type of data needed by the outputs, though a series of compatible transformations. Like Dominos, each card has some sockets, only in this case, we can have several sockets for input (on the top), and several for output (on the bottom). Some cards may not have input sockets, others may not have output sockets.

## Reading: *The Casual Creator by Kate Compton*:
- In this dissertation, I’m defining a new genre of software, the “Knit Magic” of software, in which creativity is both restricted and supported to allow greater accessibility, ease of use, and, perhaps, greater creativity because of that.
- it’s particularly useful when looking at these casual creator systems, whether a Rainbow Loom or the Spore Creature Creator, because it walks so easily around the tangential issues of age and audience and gender that get bound up with traditional marketing genres, which construct commercially-useful groupings of target consumers, rather than intellectually-productive groupings of software.
- Casual creator definition: 
an authored system or software that:
1. privileges enjoyment of the creative process above productivity
2. encourages and supports a state of creative flow
3. results in the user’s feeling of pride and ownership toward the produced artifact, and sense of pride in their own creativity.
- Why hasn’t anyone identified this field yet?
Partly, audience.  Though there are exceptions, this field has traditionally been sold as a young, or female, which is a recipe for not being taken seriously by either academics or software engineers.
- A definition of creativity (centered on production): Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one.

### Issues/Debates:

### Tools/Exercises?:

- Maybe print of some Generonimos and try and apply it to a game? *http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/generominos.pdf* Print some off and go through the scenarios maybe? See how to use these cards to understand HOW computers work better/how input/output is played out. 
- http://tracery.io : text generating (can create twitter bots). *this is a pretty complex tool tbh*
- Elegy to a dead world: creative writing game
