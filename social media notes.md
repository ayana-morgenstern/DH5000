## *Reading: "10 ways to get started fighting internet propaganda" by Kris Shaffer*:
- Internet propaganda is such a big problem that it can't go un-addressed. But it's such a big problem that it can be overwhelming to know how to resist it.
- I define propaganda as the use of one or more media to communicate a message, with the aim of changing someone's mind or actions via psychological manipulation, rather than reasoned discourse.
**- Disinformation vs misinformation: Disinformation (from the Russian dezinformatsiya) is an information operation that deliberately attempts to deceive. Misinformation, on the other hand, is an inadvertent sharing of false or misleading information.
**_How to resist_**:
1. Fact check
Check for previous fact-checking work
Go upstream to the source
Read laterally
2. Don't share
3. Follow the right people
4. Be skeptical of the right things
5. Don't duplicate work
6. Learn a few good APIs (application programming interfaces)
7. Get comfortable with web scraping
8. Compare multiple networks
9. Don't dox
10. Join D4D (Data for Democracy)

## *Reading: "BREAKING UP WITH FACEBOOK: UNTETHERING FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL FREIGHT OF ONLINE SURVEILLANCE" by Estee Beck*:
- the addition of Facebook’s GraphSearch — a super search engine based on phrases — affirmed how much data the social media company had about users, and established Facebook’s willingness to share such data with just about whomever wanted access. 
- Tracking technologies mine our browsers for data; computer algorithms take the data, run calculations, and output personalized information for the user.
- Ultimately, the discussion of a refracted online experience addresses a larger conversation about the persuasive abilities of computer algorithms and code. 
- With personalized advertisements and recommendations, we might turn to ask, what are we not seeing? How are we being categorized? Might this be a form of discriminatory practice?
- We can no longer afford to sit passively by while surveillance technologies harvest our data because there is too much at stake.
