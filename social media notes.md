## *Reading: "10 ways to get started fighting internet propaganda" by Kris Shaffer*:
- Internet propaganda is such a big problem that it can't go un-addressed. But it's such a big problem that it can be overwhelming to know how to resist it.
- I define propaganda as the use of one or more media to communicate a message, with the aim of changing someone's mind or actions via psychological manipulation, rather than reasoned discourse.
**- Disinformation vs misinformation: Disinformation (from the Russian dezinformatsiya) is an information operation that deliberately attempts to deceive. Misinformation, on the other hand, is an inadvertent sharing of false or misleading information.
**_How to resist_**:
1. Fact check
Check for previous fact-checking work
Go upstream to the source
Read laterally
2. Don't share
3. Follow the right people
4. Be skeptical of the right things
5. Don't duplicate work
6. Learn a few good APIs (application programming interfaces)
7. Get comfortable with web scraping
8. Compare multiple networks
9. Don't dox
10. Join D4D (Data for Democracy)
