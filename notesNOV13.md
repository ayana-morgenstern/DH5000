# Visualization

When is something not data?

Visualization: telling a story (purpose). Visualization can be misleading. 
a mapping between discrete data and visual representation.

Data: spatial, non-spatial, numeric, non-numeric.

### Visualization: 
Information: Graphs, pie charts, line graphs. 
Scientific: --> Spatial: think of eclipse image/data. Look at trends. 
Geovisualization: maps and cartography, using data. Telling lots of different stories: politics, geography. 
Can be used in medical fields, can be distorted. Ie: facial reconstruction.

### The Disney Article
Slippage between different domains: IE: DATA and FILM. Using same tools for different fields: CT SCANS. 
Sheet music as visualization. 
datadrivendj.com SO COOL study music.
Gotta put data in correctly.

### General thoughts:
Sometimes we find what we are looking for; but we need to look at other factors/patterns in the data. 
Sometimes visualization needs to be explained. Show what is going on. 

TOOLS: Timeline, Exhibit, Modest Maps, Visual.li, Fusion Charts. JavaScript.info.thistoolkit. 

Exercise: Visual representation of the self. Are there patterns and what do they mean? Why are they happening?
