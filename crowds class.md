The Digital Space:
Idea of self vs crowd. Presentation of the self (ie Facebook). Performance of the self. 
- Defining community: personal connection. self-identification. intentional engagement. more formal leadership. Set requirements for belonging. sometimes is imposed as a means of control of a demographic: ie indigenous peoples. 
- Defining Crowds: less interpersonal. negative iterations of communities. mob  mentality. involuntary membership/ more situational, less permanent. more self-serving. 
- alternative to community: a network.
