## - What is text?
The wording of anything written or printed, the structure formed by the words in their order. 
BUT... What is it really? 
1. Letters
2. Books
3. Novel
4. Words
5. Newspapers

What is it made up of? What is included in textual analysis? Multi-modal? Are we including visuals? 
Digital world has increased it: Tweets, blogs, articles. Music. Lyrics. Images. Hypertext. 
Our understanding of discourse is much more complex than a computer's understanding of discourse.

## - What is text analysis?
Text analysis is a technological tool that allows for information to be apprehended from large amounts of data as a means to track patterns and trends. 
*Close reading is also text analysis* 
This definition could be too static because text analysis cannot be done one way: data can be interpreted. Should the interpretation/goal be there? Not just about tracking, but also about comparing. Conclusive element: interpret/theory/conclusion. Can also be a way to manipulate data. 
Is technology essential? 
Nature of the data sets: a defined "universe/sample". Also identify patterns and trends as opposed to just tracking them. 
Text analysis is like looking for webs of meaning throughout and across texts. 
Text analysis as a "facet viewer".

## Close Reading Vs. Distant Reading

Close Reading:
1. Focuses on a small amount of text.
2. often does the work that a computer cannot.
3. Possibly more subjective.
4. Deeper comprehension of language.

Distant Reading:
1. Focuses on a large amont of text.
2. Often does the work that a human cannot.
3. Pssobily more objective (altho code/computers are created by humans and thus do have bias as well)
4. A more semantic comprehension of language.

So which is better? Depends on the analysis needed/wanted as well as the sample size. 

## Disciplinary Fears
Fear of impact on jobs. Fear of losing credibility. Fear of losing "purity" of discipline. Development of art and culture. 
Sense of "us" versus "them" --> Embracing challenge of technology and art intersecting. 

## Text Analysis Activity - Part 1

The article is about the opiod crisis. Textual features: short sentences. Repetition of key words. Do we want to count things like articles? What about words that are pluralized? Should this be one word or two? Accuracy: we skim over things. 
Good thing we have tools that do this!

Reading for content versus reading for data type things. 

## Text Analysis Activity - Part 2
How we can get a lot from a "text" just from a list of keywords: we can try and figure out content and context, but other than associations, we need the context. 

## Tools

- Hypothesis Annotations visualized. 
1. Word clouds. Shows words that are most commonly used. Using visualization. Doesn't tell us HOW often or in what CONTEXT they are used.
2. Sentiment analysis: Are they very negative or positive?  Sentiment scores. 
CONTEXT IS KEY!!!!!!!! Sentiment analysis can miss out on context IE: Interesting can be a positive or negative word? 
- AntConc: A freeware corpus analysis toolkit for concordancing and text analysis (Tutorial on programming historian for this). 
What does it do? It creates a corpus, finds collocates, finds clusters, counts word and phrase frequency.

*Every tool has a degree of bias/limitations* 
Pick what works best for you and what you are studying/trying to get. *Shiny Hammer problem: You apply this tool to everything because it is awesome*.
