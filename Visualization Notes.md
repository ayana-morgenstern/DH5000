# Visualization

There are lots of different ways to use visualization: it is important to pick how to represent the data based on what you want your audience to understand from it. Visualization can be misleading.

## Reading: The Insta-Dead:

Look at rhetoric surrounding social media posts selling human remains. 

### Methods:

- in the version of the data that we have made available via our supporting data and code repository we have attempted to strip out usernames in the captions themselves, and we have not provided the account usernames in our table of data. We did keep this information for our actual analysis. We do provide the link to the original post and the original photograph. The only other metadata included is the user ID number, the number of likes, and the number of comments.

- We initially employed a variation of a 'snowball' sampling strategy, beginning at known collectors of human remains on Instagram, documented in previous research (Huffer et al. in press) ('natural selections', 'Oddmonton', 'sickeart', '_craniac_') to see what some of the common hashtags employed were. Our initial list of hashtags:

#humanbones
#humanskulls
#oddities
#curiosities
#realbone
#trophyskulls

- Data sample was not always what they were looking for: had to ask a new question to find more directly relevant posts.
- *If we assume that a person new to the community wanting to buy or sell human remains will explicitly use the '#humanskulls' or '#humanbones' hashtag, what will they find on Instagram? What does Instagram look like from that perspective?* 

### Language of the Posts:

- Through filtering the data, they end up with the most common words in this corpus of Instagram posts that are otherwise uncommon in day-to-day English.
ie:

1. skulls 3679
2. oddities 2644
3. oddity 1287
4. macabre 1223
5. curiosities 984
6. taxidermy 775
7. goth 717
8. handpainted 608
9. crafty 585
10. curiosity 505

### *By contrast, without the comparison to the Trillion Word Corpus, the top words are*:

1. skull 11,308
2. the 5931
3. a 4264
4. skulls 3679
5. and 3665
6. of 3582
7. to 3351
8. art 3220
9. in 2913
10. bones 2787

a clear pattern emerges. We can see that this community frames their engagement with human remains as an experience with the 'other' - skulls and human remains are objects valued primarily for their ability to invoke the thrill of owning something taboo. The words 'taxidermy', 'goth', 'handpainted', 'crafty' point to another interesting pattern in this corpus: the reuse of human (and, clearly, animal) remains for 'artistic' reworking, as well as other forms of art inspired by bone motifs.

*Sentiment Analysis*:

- Obvioulsy (to me at least) the words used are more "negative" than "positive". But we're talking about death so duh. 

*Topic Models*: 

- Note the close association of topics clearly connected with buying and selling, and topics related to trophy skulls and other indigenous ethnographic materials. While a post might not necessarily mention a trophy skull being bought and sold, the patterns of discourse are very similar. These materials are not being discussed with respect, but as commodities.
- Indeed, topic 25 seems roughly to be the dividing line between people who are interested in skulls and bones as a motif/inspiration for their art, and for those who wish to possess the dead.

*Social Network Structures*:

- From 22 accounts directly proclaiming to sell human remains, analyzing their followers. 3 groups emerge.

The first group (users 1, 14, 15, 19, 20) is what we might call the specialists, that is, accounts explicitly selling mostly bones. The second (users 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 22) are the generalists that seem to have a much wider variety of materials than just bone. Finally we have the enthusiasts (users 8 onwards), that is, users who for the most part enjoy looking at pictures of human remains. The present analysis cannot be pushed any further than this, and the topic as a whole awaits further investigation. We gesture towards it only for the sake of completeness of the present study. 

*Hashtag Stuffing*: 

- Are there patterns of text reuse in this corpus? And if so, what does that signify?
- The patterning of hashtags and the reuse of sequences of tags seems, on this reading, to be a sign of influence between users or a sign of community, a marker of imagined connection between users.

Placing so many hashtags into a post is also a kind of search-engine optimisation technique known as 'hashtag stuffing'. Actually typing so many tags over and over again on a phone or tablet is difficult, and so we are probably also looking at text shortcuts and expansion to make the process easier and more consistent. 

### Photographic Analysis:

- Look at "visual grammar" of the images.
