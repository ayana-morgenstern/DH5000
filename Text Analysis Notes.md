## Reading: *How Not To Read A Million Books*

About what not to read. 

About casting a wider net, using text-mining to:
 1. identify word boundaries, sentence boundaries, standard spellings, parts of speech and lemmata.
 2. find patterns in a single work, in a subset of the MONK collection, or across everything we have.
 ... Example:
 1. With Gertrude Stein's novel it:  applied “a frequent pattern analysis algorithm” that looked at every sequence of 
 three words in the book, and any patterns across those trigrams, but “executing the algorithm on 
 *Making* generated thousands of patterns since each slight variation in a repetition generated a new pattern."
 2. Appearance of the devil: we can see WHEN figures appear in texts and what these patterns mean.
 
### Best Practices when Data Mining:
1. Make assumptions explicit
2. Use multiple representations and methodologies
3. Report all trials (including failures)
4. Make data available and methods reproducible
5. Engage in peer review of methodology

### General Thoughts:
- About what is absent. How texts differ from each other as much as how they are similar. 
- Skepticism: Specifically, they point out that there are some key practices and assumptions in data-mining and machine 
learning that literary users of these tools may not fully appreciate or understand, and that without an understanding 
of fundamental principles, it is easy to misinterpret or overstate the significance of statistical results:
The temptation in applying machine learning methods to humanities data is to interpret a computed result as some 
form of proof or determinate answer. In this case, the validity of the evidence lies inherent in the technology. This can 
be problematic when the methods are treated as a black box, a critic ex machina.
- Have to be careful about manipulating data: can use it to prove different things. 

## Reading: *Text Analysis, Data Mining and Visualizations* 

Going against the idea that digital applications/tools take the "human" out of literary study.

The Digital Literary Studies: 
text analysis, visualization, and data mining represent paradigmatic shifts in the work of the humanities that force scholars to reflect on the relation between information and new media and technology and that require them
“to investigate underlying database, data-flow, cross-platform data architecture”.

About using data mining/visualization to defamiliarize texts!

Differences between close and distant readings. *About using both*
* Observations about the data-mining process made by collaborators also support the supposition that it is the combination of data mining and visualization (distant reading) with the ability to read and contextualize one’s results (close reading) that generated many of the most productive studies and that is needed to address the remaining gaps and difficulties. 

# Four approaches to studying literature:
1. As rhetoric or practical criticism: “the examination of diction and syntax, rhythm and repetition, and the various figures of speech”.
2. As philosophy or the “potential expression of truth and knowledge”.
3. As art or a unique aesthetic construct—a form of discourse inherently other, of which the objective is the “pleasure of representation” and the “pleasure of recognition,” or the pleasure “of taking in impersonations, fictions, and language creations of others and recognizing their justice”.
4. As “cultural production”—“for its political role, its exposure of the state of a given society”.

Having a "wide" reading gives greater pleasure and greater ability to make connections between texts. 
Also about silences!
Using tools to facilitate differential reading practices can facilitate self-reflective or self-conscious critical practices by helping us interpret the patterns we see in texts and in how others have read texts.

# 3 Steps for Data Mining
1. determine decision criteria for classification. The decision criteria could include features of the text to be analyzed such as n-grams (n number of characters or words of text), parts of speech, or phonetic sounds and certain behaviors or relations such as words or phrases that are repeated or words or phrases that are collocated (found in proximity to one another). 
2.use the data-mining algorithm to analyze and map the behavior of or patterns created by the decision criteria in a subset of the document collection or corpora. 
3. use the data-mining algorithm to apply that mapping to new documents to find similar patterns or behaviors.

Close reading and distant reading in data-mining projects are facilitated most by “technologies of collaboration”.

Must be aware of research bias: but everything humans do is naturally biased so I don't see the big fuss with this.
