##Reading: *"The Argument Made By The Absence: On Whiteness, Polychromy, And Diversity In Classics" by Sarah Bond:*

- pol·y·chro·my: the art of painting in several colors, especially as applied to ancient pottery, sculpture, and architecture.

- My main thesis is that despite our knowledge of the prevalence of polychromy on ancient statuary, there is a predominantly neon white display of skin tone in respect to classical statues and sarcophagi. This assemblage of neon whiteness thus creates a false sense of homogeneity across the Mediterranean world.  Moreover the idea that white marble is beauty is not an inherent truth of the universe; it was in part developed by influential art historians during the early modern period in Europe.\
- About fighting inherent whiteness in history and classics studies: antiquity was very diverse and we are responsible for changing our "white" perception of it.
