# Outline

## Introduction:
- History of computational creativity *emerging field/new* 
- Definition (from class and readings). *Definition of creativity:*  Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one.
- Include the video of "Can Computers Be Creative".
- Types of computational creativity:
1. Photobashing
2. Casual Creator
3. Text Generator/Bots
4. Twine/Inform type games/programs
- Debates/Issues emerging from computational creativity:
1. How do we define creativity? Should a computer/program act as an aid/guide for creativity, or can it be creative/should it be creative on its own? Is that true creativity? How do we program creativity/spontaneity?
2. Should we priviledge emotional involvement/flow?
3. How important is the intent behind the results?
4. How can we give a system intent/Emotional involvement?

## Exercises/Case Study:
- Generonimos (get students to follow some scenarios or come up with their own, and then discuss what the exercise makes them understand/question about computational creativity)
- Do something using Inform (simple hyperlink/choose-your-own-adventure type project **this would be optional/for students who are really interested in the topic/project**)
- Have an interactive space for students to list/brainstorm where they've encountered computational creativity. Examples:
1. Sketch A bit
2. Elegy for A dead World
3. Oregon Trail
4. Music Improvising software
5. Google Dream Bot

## Tools/Games/Programs (To be added to as needed/found):
- Generonimos http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/generominos.pdf 
- Tracery http://tracery.io : text generating (can create twitter bots). this is a pretty complex tool tbh
- Twine (interactive fiction design tool). http://twinery.org
- Inform 7 (hyperlink/create your own adventure
- Sketch-a-bit (Android Game)
- Elegy to a dead world: creative writing game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfps2HKE4B4
