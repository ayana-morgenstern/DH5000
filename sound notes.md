# Sound

## Reading: *The Ground Truth of DH Text Mining* by TANYA E. CLEMENT: 
In the digital humanities, text mining is a logocentric practice. That is, text mining in digital humanities usually begins with The Word. We extract The Word; we count The Word; we stem The Word to its root; we parse The Word; we name The Word; we disambiguate The Word; we collocate The Word; we count The Word again; we apply an algorithm that allows us to reconstruct the world of The Word as one we can visualize as a list, as a line graph, as a histogram in small multiples, or on big screens. We use the view this new world provides us to interpret The Word.
This practice of text mining presupposes a binary logic; there is meaning in the results or there is not.
**Mining sound is very different from mining text; more questions to consider like who is listening, what are we mining, how long is a sound?**
