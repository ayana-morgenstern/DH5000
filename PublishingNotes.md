# Publishing 

## Planned Obsolescence
-I've read this a bunch in my own studies, and I find it really interesting how this works in terms of scholarship and publishing as opposed to just technology and ideas/intellectual work. 

## Reading: *Create a New Open Textbook* by the BC Open Textbook Project:
### Some noteworthy stuff on Open Textbooks:
Open textbooks are not geographically limited
Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER); they are instructional resources created and shared in ways so that more people have access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials.

There are 5 rules that govern good textbook format:
1. Rule of Frameworks. 
Memory and understanding are promoted by the use of a structure that mimics the structures we all use within our minds to store information.
2. Rule of Meaningful Names.
Everything we know is tagged with an index or a title. These indices are critical to the ability to recall or retrieve the things we know and remember
3. Rule of Manageable Numbers.
When we learn from an outline, an illustration, or an example; most of us are limited in our ability to absorb new material. As we become familiar with part of a subject domain this number expands, but for new material four to six new elements is a reasonable limit
4. Rule of Hierarchy.
Our mental frameworks are hierarchical. Learning is aided by using the studentâ€™s ability to couple or link new material with that already mastered. When presenting new domains for hierarchical understanding, the rules for meaningful names and manageable numbers have increased importance and more limited application. A maximum of three levels of hierarchy should be presented at one time.
5. Rule of Repetition.
Most people learn by repetition, and only a few with native genius can achieve mastery without it. 

**Obviously it is also a useful resource when it comes to help with Pressbooks.**
