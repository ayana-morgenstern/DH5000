# Accessibility

Alvaro's Presentation/Seminar:
A11Y: Accessibility --> 11 letters between the A and Y. 

What is accessibility?
- Is it as simple as saying access and everything it entails? Meaning of a word can be subjective. 
- General terms vs Digital terms. 
What does it include, what does it not include?

### General Accessibility:
- braille
- ease of access
- assistive technology
- visual/auditory accessibility. 
- Motor-skill/function assistance. 
- speech: producing as well as interpreting. 
- visible vs. non-visible disability. 
- colour blindness. 

### Digital Accessibility:
- Raw formats (interoperability). 
- availability across platforms and devices. ie: mobile. future proofing. 
- usability: interaction, language (plain versus complex)
- what specific problems do digital platforms bring up that are different from "real-world" accessibility: context specific issues. 

### Biases and Stereotypes:
- Ableism: everyone who is able bodied is normal and everyone else is not normal: we expect those who are "not normal" to addapt to their environment as opposed to adapting their environment to them. 
- Disabled = broken? What is the norm? What do we consider as differently abled? IE: glasses. Disability creep --> aging population. 
- Assistive vs adaptive technology: assistive includes adaptive. Adaptive sits on top of other technology : ie closed captioning. 
Assistive is created to perform interactions with the abilities they already have: Wheelchairs, hearing aids.

## Impact of Accessibility:
### Public Spaces:
- Assumptions are made about access: IE: wheelchair ramps (when someone has to ask for a ramp). 
- Idea of retrofitting: make assumptions that are difficult to understand. Not always how it happens best/we think meeting "minimum requirements" is enough. 
- Online shopping: public online space. If you're dyslexic, how do you shop, how does the typography affect you?

### Citizen Engagement:
- Voting and accessibility. 
- Participation in public activities: protest!
- Employment: unemployment double for those with disabilities. 
- Digital engagement with government: filing taxes!

### Social Participation: 
- Language barriers: the main language on the internet is English. Translation issues. Google translate: programmed by people. 
- Forming of gangs... ostracizing. 
- Policy interpretation?

### A11Y can be contextual:
- Virtually attending class: if the underlying infrastructure has not been thought through, we can create accessibility issues.

### Plain language and academia:
- Academic writing is not always accessible
- is this a credibility/construction of identity issue?
- do we want people to only enter discourse when they have the context/background knowledge?
- Assimilation and Accomodation: how we learn and put things into our mental models first, and then modify mental models.
- Is academic writing in the middle?
- Is there a move to becoming more accessible?
