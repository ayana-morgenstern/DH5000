## Reading: *"Community" by Bridget Draxler* :

There are problems with the term community: can foster a false sense of belonging/be used to manipulate (think about online community). But also can be hopeful.

- Digital spaces exacerbate this tension in the academy’s relationship to a term like “community.” Digital tools can seem to undermine traditional notions of community, highlighting the term’s meaninglessness through the apparent detachment of virtual engagement. The idea of “digital community” can seem like an oxymoron, with the fluidity, expansiveness, and disembodiment of online groups. But if digital tools are changing and questioning our understanding of what constitutes community, they are also giving us new ways of engaging with community, and new communities to engage with.

-  The notion that community is something to actively and intentionally create, rather than something you’re born into, gives participants deeper agency and investment–a quality that is not exclusive to virtual communities but is certainly championed by them. And, joining communities by choice online can make us rethink, for better or worse, the communities we find ourselves in by default.

- For the twenty-first-century humanist, the community is not our audience but our collaborator.

### Curated Artifacts (Examples): 

- 18th Connect: 18th Connect is a database of eighteenth-century texts driven by values of sharing and service. Along with features typical of online communities (discussions, groups) and scholarly communities (peer review, searchable archives), it offers scholars and advanced students an opportunity to receive plain and TEI-encoded copies of texts from ProQuest and Gale in exchange for correcting any OCR errors in these texts.

- Grinnel Beowulf: Engaging students in the task of translating and annotating Beowulf for modern readers, Tim Arner (Grinnell College) created a for-students, by-students teaching edition of the early English text. The digital text offers an example of how public digital humanities projects can reframe students as teachers, democratizing not only access to but production of knowledge online.

- The Passport Project: The Passport Project is an innovative first-year course that asks students to blog about community events representing the arts, humanities, sciences, along with political events and performances in dance, theater, and music. Peer Mentors, recent graduates of the program, lead small group discussions. 

- Intro to Public Arts & Humanities: In Elizabeth Goodhue’s Intro to Public Arts & Humanities course, undergraduate students spend a week discussing the intersection of community engagement and digital humanities.

- AnnoTate: Volunteers transcribe diaries, letters and other manuscripts to make these archives searchable and accessible to new readers.

- HASTAC: HASTAC is an example of an online community in its best form, with a diverse and active readership.

- Mapping the Republic of Letters: that contextualizes the intellectual network of key early modern thinkers. By identifying moments of exchange and influence, the tool reframes Western thought from a series of important figures to a rich intellectual community. 

- Our Marathon: Our Marathon invites community contributors to share stories, images, and other media of their experiences. The crowd-sourced storytelling archive is intended explicitly as a tool for community healing, and a means of creating an organic, community-driven memorial.

- Public Matters: is "an interdisciplinary, social enterprise" dedicated to designing and implementing "innovative programs that build social, creative, and civic capital in communities." 

- Artists in Community: serves as a model of a discipline-specific community engagement project that capitalizes on digital technology and relationship building to create partnerships between students and non-profit agencies.
