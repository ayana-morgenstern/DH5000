## Reading: *"Community" by Bridget Draxler* :

There are problems with the term community: can foster a false sense of belonging/be used to manipulate (think about online community). But also can be hopeful.

- Digital spaces exacerbate this tension in the academy’s relationship to a term like “community.” Digital tools can seem to undermine traditional notions of community, highlighting the term’s meaninglessness through the apparent detachment of virtual engagement. The idea of “digital community” can seem like an oxymoron, with the fluidity, expansiveness, and disembodiment of online groups. But if digital tools are changing and questioning our understanding of what constitutes community, they are also giving us new ways of engaging with community, and new communities to engage with.

-  The notion that community is something to actively and intentionally create, rather than something you’re born into, gives participants deeper agency and investment–a quality that is not exclusive to virtual communities but is certainly championed by them. And, joining communities by choice online can make us rethink, for better or worse, the communities we find ourselves in by default.

- For the twenty-first-century humanist, the community is not our audience but our collaborator.

### Curated Artifacts (Examples): 

- 18th Connect: 18th Connect is a database of eighteenth-century texts driven by values of sharing and service. Along with features typical of online communities (discussions, groups) and scholarly communities (peer review, searchable archives), it offers scholars and advanced students an opportunity to receive plain and TEI-encoded copies of texts from ProQuest and Gale in exchange for correcting any OCR errors in these texts.

- Grinnel Beowulf: Engaging students in the task of translating and annotating Beowulf for modern readers, Tim Arner (Grinnell College) created a for-students, by-students teaching edition of the early English text. The digital text offers an example of how public digital humanities projects can reframe students as teachers, democratizing not only access to but production of knowledge online.

- The Passport Project: The Passport Project is an innovative first-year course that asks students to blog about community events representing the arts, humanities, sciences, along with political events and performances in dance, theater, and music. Peer Mentors, recent graduates of the program, lead small group discussions. 

- Intro to Public Arts & Humanities: In Elizabeth Goodhue’s Intro to Public Arts & Humanities course, undergraduate students spend a week discussing the intersection of community engagement and digital humanities.

- AnnoTate: Volunteers transcribe diaries, letters and other manuscripts to make these archives searchable and accessible to new readers.

- HASTAC: HASTAC is an example of an online community in its best form, with a diverse and active readership.

- Mapping the Republic of Letters: that contextualizes the intellectual network of key early modern thinkers. By identifying moments of exchange and influence, the tool reframes Western thought from a series of important figures to a rich intellectual community. 

- Our Marathon: Our Marathon invites community contributors to share stories, images, and other media of their experiences. The crowd-sourced storytelling archive is intended explicitly as a tool for community healing, and a means of creating an organic, community-driven memorial.

- Public Matters: is "an interdisciplinary, social enterprise" dedicated to designing and implementing "innovative programs that build social, creative, and civic capital in communities." 

- Artists in Community: serves as a model of a discipline-specific community engagement project that capitalizes on digital technology and relationship building to create partnerships between students and non-profit agencies.

## Reading: *"Can History be Open Source? Wikipedia and the Future of the Past" by Roy Rosenzweig*:

- Wikipedia is entirely free. And that freedom includes not just the ability of anyone to read it (a freedom denied by the scholarly journals in, say, jstor, which requires an expensive institutional subscription) but also—more remarkably—their freedom to use it. This extraordinary freedom and cooperation make Wikipedia the most important application of the principles of the free and open-source software movement to the world of cultural, rather than software, production.

### How Wikipedia works:
- "Wikipedia,"they declare first, "is an encyclopedia. Its goals go no further." Personal essays, dictionary entries, critical reviews, "propaganda or advocacy," and "original research" are excluded. 
- The second key Wikipedian injunction is to "avoid bias." "Articles should be written from a neutral point of view [npov]," they insist, "representing differing views on a subject factually and objectively."
- Of course, writing "without bias"—even in the circumscribed way that Wikipedia defines it—is, as Wikipedians concede, "difficult" since "all articles are edited by people" and "people are inherently biased."
- The gfdl (and gpl) deviate most surprisingly from conventional intellectual property rules by giving you the freedom to use the text however you wish. As the license states: "You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided . . . you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.

### Wikipedia as History:
- Participation in Wikipedia entries generally maps popular, rather than academic, interests in history. 
- Wikipedia's authors do not come from a cross-section of the world's population. They are more likely to be English-speaking, males, and denizens of the Internet. Such bias has occasioned much discussion, including among Wikipedians. A page of candid self-criticism titled "Why Wikipedia Is Not So Great," acknowledges that "geek priorities" have shaped the encyclopedia
- the largest bias—at least in the English-language version—favors Western culture (and English-speaking nations), rather than geek or popular culture.
- Thus, the free and open-source encyclopedia Wikipedia offers a formidable challenge to the well-established and seemingly authoritative Encyclopedia Britannica as well as to Microsoft's newer and well-regarded Encarta.
- Overall, writing is the Achilles' heel of Wikipedia. Committees rarely write well, and Wikipedia entries often have a choppy quality that results from the stringing together of sentences or paragraphs written by different people. Some Wikipedians contribute their services as editors and polish the prose of different articles. But they seem less numerous than other types of volunteers. Few truly gifted writers volunteer for Wikipedia. Encarta, while less comprehensive than Wikipedia, generally offers better—especially, more concise—writing.
- The wiki software allows you to compare every single version of an article going back to its creation.
- Another possible improvement would have readers rate the quality of individual Wikipedia entries, an approach used by a number of popular Internet sites,

### Why Should We Care? Implications for Historians:
- One reason professional historians need to pay attention to Wikipedia is because our students do.
- when you search Google for some obscure term that Wikipedia knows about, you might get two dozen results that all say the same thing—seemingly authoritative until you realize they all spread from a snapshot of Wiki—one that is now severed from the context of editability and might seem more creditable than it really is."
- Teachers have little more to fear from students' starting with Wikipedia than from their starting with most other basic reference sources. They have a lot to fear if students stop there. To state the obvious: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and encyclopedias have intrinsic limits.
